**Solution Description**

**User story** – Regulatory compliance refers to the information that must, by law, be reported and recorded in the event of a work-related accident or incident. This Power BI solution displays the info needed for RIDDOR compliance, as well as some basic metrics.

**Persona** – This dashboard is for Health and safety managers, allowing them to quickly fill out RIDDOR compliance forms, and manage their company’s Health and safety data.

**Data** – It is based on A14 incident data, coming from the excel document ‘A14 incident log’.



**Solution Detailed Description**

The dashboard is just one main page. At the top there are cards showing key information, like number of incidents in the last month, year, YTD etc. 
There is a large table showing all the information with entries for all the incidents, and all the information needed for RIDDOR compliance. 
There is a graph in the top right-hand corner to show incidents over time, as well as a monthly rolling average. Finally, there are filters for time, Category, Section and Classification, allowing you to narrow down both the table entries, as well as filtering the cards to get the same metrics but for specific categories, such as the number of near misses. 

**Solution Review**

Insights – The solution is mostly complete as is given the data provided. Potentially in the future could have forms that autofill but would need access to the compliance forms in order to access the viability of this.
