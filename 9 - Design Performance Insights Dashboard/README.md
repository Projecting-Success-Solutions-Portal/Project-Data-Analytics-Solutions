**Solution Detailed Description**

A solution to manage design performance on a construction project and gain performance insights across a portfolio of construction projects. Using data exported from a Tier 1 Main Contractors Common Data Environment (CDE) across their national portfolio of projects, key performance indicators such as number of revisions, RFIs and other meta-data is analysed in real time. Some interesting insights were gained from this dataset that facilitated targeted action. With the addition of other datasets such as programme updates the power of this solution will increase greatly. Data can be viewed through a number of filters including Project Value, Location, Sector and Project Status.

**Solution Review**

Insights-
This solution identified a number of projects that had drawing revision numbers and RFIs that far exceeded the mean
The tool then identifies packages of work that are not developed to the required level for the stage-gate
Other data sources such as programme data would add more valuable functions and insight
