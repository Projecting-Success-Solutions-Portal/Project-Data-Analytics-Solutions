**Solution Description**

**User story** – This solution provides project managers a tool to generate risk registers for their projects, these can then be updated as the project progresses. The tool also provides a risk pot and an insight page to view visuals for any given project.

**Persona** – As a project manager I can easily create and manage risks involved in a project. I can see how these risks develop throughout the project's lifetime and gain insights from the visuals for each project. 

**Data** – All data is collected from within Powerapps and stored in a Dataverse table




**Solution Detailed Description**

Users can quickly begin to create risk registers for projects and easily add risks by selecting items from the pre-populated dropdowns. Once a register has been created, it can be updated to adjust the risks as the project progresses. Previous versions of the register can also be viewed. 
For each project, a risk pot and insight page is auto-generated. The risk pot summarises the financial costs of the risks that are present, whilst the insight page displays visuals using the data that has been recorded for the selected project. 

**Solution Review**

Insights – A centralised source of data will allow for detailed analysis in the future.
