**Solution Description**

**User story** – A solution to monitor health and safety incidents across various projects, and to aid prevention and increase understanding. 

**Persona** – Overall view of H&S for an executive, director, or project manager to check monthly. 

**Data** – Data was provided by a Tier 1 Main Contractor from a large project. 

**Solution Detailed Description**

A solution to visualise the common causes and severity of Health and Safety Incidents and their rate over time. With the data provided, some useful insight is provided into common causes of injury, and what actions can be taken to prevent this. With more data, more prevention analysis can be conducted, allowing a project manager to take effective steps to mitigate risk. The overview can also be filtered by date. 

**Solution Review**

Insights – 
•	This solution identified the most common causes of injuries, the job roles at the most risk, and what time in the year incidents are most frequent.
•	Through the prevention and understanding pages, further insight is gained into how incidents occur. This means more can be done to help prevent them, from providing extra protective equipment for the most commonly injured body parts, to extra training at certain locations.
•	With more data this solution would become even more powerful, as more prevention metrics could be used to plan future projects.
