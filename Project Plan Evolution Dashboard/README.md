**Solution Description**

**User story** – The client wanted to understand the impacts of updates and changes to the project schedule and monitor these updates when they happen.

**Persona** – For project managers so that they can keep track of the projects and the impacts updates have on the schedule and monitor these updates on demand.
The client wants to see live updates to the project schedule that is brought about by these changes.

**Data** – The data came from nPlan from one of their existing data sets after it had been anonymised. 



**Solution Detailed Description**

The solution provides a general overview of the activities, milestones and links for the project. Then goes into detail regarding the variance between planned and actual start/end dates for activities and milestones. Finally, it demonstrates a feature we would want to add had the data not be anonymised where we highlight key ‘high risk’ or ‘mission critical’ activities such as cranage and finds the average delay of any of these activities across multiple projects, which can then be used to derive an average cost for this risk.

**Solution Review**

Insights – Conceptual overview of ‘high risk’ activities regarding cranage and what the potential cost induced by the expected delay based on averages from previous projects, to aid in decision-making and put contingencies in place for future projects.
