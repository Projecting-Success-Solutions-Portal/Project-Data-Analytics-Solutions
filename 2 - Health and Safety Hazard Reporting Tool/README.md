**Solution Description**

**User story** – This solution is an application that allows us to capture health and safety data easily and efficiently on hazards and incidents that occur on a project. It is a user-friendly app that allows personnel to easily record this information, therefore encouraging use and adoption. 

**Persona** – This app has 2 main types of users. One is site personnel, who will use the app to report observations as they occur on the site. The other is for H&S managers, who can view observations from site personnel, as well as create their own. They can also view and submit hazards, including submitting a photo.

**Data** – This is a Power Apps solution with data recorded to a central repository. Data schemas have been provided for the incidents and observations, and the data recorded should be consistent with this schema. 


**Solution Detailed Description**

The App is comprised of 4 pages: Home page, Incident Page, Hazard Page and Submission Page. The home page consists of login buttons for the 2 types of users: H&S manager and site personnel. It has buttons to navigate to the Incident page (just H&S managers) and Hazard page (all users).

The Incident page has a gallery to view/edit existing incidents, as well as a form to submit a new incident. On submission of the form, the user is sent to the submission page. This page is only visible to H&S managers.

The hazard page is a form to submit a new hazard. At the bottom the user can submit a photo of the hazard. On submission the user is taken to the submission page.
The submission page displays a message to show the submission was successful and has navigation buttons to the incident and hazard pages (whichever are accessible to the user).

**Solution Review**

Insights – This solution came out well, producing an easy to use app for site personnel and H&S safety managers alike. Some improvements could be made by using machine learning to recognize the hazard from the photo.
