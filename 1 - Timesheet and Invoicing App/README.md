**Solution Description**

User story – The Timesheet app allows users to quickly log any hours they spent working towards a specified project. 

**Personas**

1. Employee: As an employee, I can simply and easily enter the hours I plan on working towards a project on a weekly basis. Once I have submitted an entry, I can view all of my previous entries and check their status’, or edit them if needs be.

2. Line Manager: As a line manager, I can view all of the time entries that my employees have made. I can then go through these entries and either accept/reject them. 

3. Project Manager: As the project manager, I can view the invoicing page which will allow me to filter time entries by any project and month. I can then export this data into a readily formatted invoice.

Data – The timesheet data is collected from the manual entries made within the app. Other data such as client & project names or employees relevant contracts and rates, are stored on a Sharepoint list/Dataverse table. 

**Solution Detailed Description**

For any given week, employees can log multiple entries at once, including time spent on different projects. There is also the option to copy weekly hours from a previous week to make things much quicker. Employees can then view all of their entries and their corresponding status’. Once an employee has submitted a time entry, their manager will be able to review this entry and respond to it.

Project Managers have the ability to use the invoicing page. Entries can be filtered by the client/project/contract and month, this data will appear in a table that summarises the hours employees have spent working on a project, their hourly rate, and the total that is to be paid by the client for this work. This table can then be exported to a dynamic invoice template which also pre-populates information such as the client’s address. 

**Solution Review**

Insights – Employees can quickly add multiple entries in one go, and even copy entries from a previous week. Managers can then at their own convenience accept/reject multiple entries at once. The ability to view the status of each entry will reduce the time employees may spend chasing managers for a response.  The invoicing feature will also save time by automating the process of creating invoices.
